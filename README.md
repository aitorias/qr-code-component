## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

I have learned to better manage media-queries properties to increase the quality of my applications and projects.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 914px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  .page {
    height: auto;
    padding-bottom: 28px;
    padding-top: 28px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my development in React and libraries such as Tailwind CSS.
